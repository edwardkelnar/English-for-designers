# Letter P

LETTER P HAS GOT THE STRONG POINTS OF EACH LATTER. IT‘S SIMPLE, CURVY AND STRONG.

### Overview: 
We will draw a green P character. 

#### Step 1.
Draw a mid size green line from top to bottom (that will be our main line) in the center of the paper.
#### Step 2.
Draw a half sircle that is attached from the top end of the line and ends in the midle so it looks like a belly.
#### Step 3.
Make a second line aligned with the main line on its left side.
#### Step 4.
Close those lines with a shorter line from left to right on the top and the bottm of these two lines.
#### Step 5.
Make sure that the both lines go a bit beyond the main lines.
#### Step 6.
Fill the space between those two taller main lines with the same green color.
#### Step 7.
After you‘re finished with that make a second smaller half sircle insdie the first one so it looks like a hole.
#### Step 8.
Fill the middle of those two circles with green.

When you‘re done it should look like a thick tall line with a belly on the top right half with a hole inside.
