## Edward Kelnar ##

I am graphic designer, copywriter, social media manager and a director of photography. When I’m not designing I’m making music and educate myself with useful information and skills. I am currently working on my bachelor degree. I am friendly, outgoing and like to learn and do new things.

I am a perfectionist but I’m also kind of a procrastinator and I rush things so I spend much more time on each project than I need to.

When I’m not designing or working I usually try to rest by slacking off or relaxing a bit but I usualy need to do something to be busy. So I have like a dozen open projects and keep on beginning new ones but only few of them get finished if any.
